# UnoEther
 This is loosely based off the [LiquidEther](https://github.com/twinec/liquidether) I made a little while ago.
 This board is part of the open source hardware project and is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.
 This commit also includes the EasyEDA file in case you want to edit the file and make it your own.
